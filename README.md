## Project Overview
This project involves typical analytical data engineering processes, starting with the ingestion of data from various sources and loading it into the Snowflake data warehouse. Within Snowflake, the data undergoes a series of transformations to prepare it for Business Intelligence (BI) purposes. The BI tool Power BI connects to the data warehouse to generate diverse dashboards and reports.
